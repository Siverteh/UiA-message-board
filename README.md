# UiA-message-board
My implementation for the projects in software security.

Assignment 3:

Objectives
<aside> üêç You are free to develop your solution using any language, but I recommend Python. You can extend your previous application from the first assignment. But I recommend using GIT (if you did not do that the first assignment, now is the time to push everything on git)

</aside>

Design and implement a user authentication system that combines OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow, conventional authentication mechanisms, a backend database, and security features such as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

The assignment consists of 5 tasks, where each task is weighted the same:

Database Integration
Basic User Authentication
Protection Against Brute Force Attacks
Two-Factor Authentication
Understanding the Concepts of OAuth2
Learning Outcomes
From this assignment, you will learn about basic databases, like JSON and SQLite. You will learn how to use them securely, having a security-first mindset. You will further learn how to create basic username-password authentication and use hashing to protect credentials. Further, you will create measures to prevent rainbow table attacks from working with rate-limiting. Then we will discover how two-factor authentication works and how it can be implemented with Python. Lastly, we will learn the basics of OAUTH2.

(20) Database Integration:
Integrate a lightweight database, e.g., JSON-based storage or SQLite, to persistently save user data.
Design efficient database schemas that optimize retrieval and storage operations while ensuring data security.
(20) Basic User Authentication:
<aside> üí° Remember to document security challenges and mitigations

</aside>

Set up a standard authentication system that allows users to sign up using a username and password.
Store user credentials securely in the database, leveraging advanced hashing and salting techniques, preferably with libraries like bcrypt or hashlib.
(20) Protection Against Brute Force Attacks:
<aside> üí° Remember to document security challenges and mitigations

</aside>

Embed a robust rate-limiting mechanism in the system to discourage repetitive password guess attempts.
Impose a mandatory time-out after three consecutive failed login attempts.
Note: You can test this by attempting to access an API endpoint several times without the correct authentication token, or trying to log in with incorrect credentials

(20) Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
<aside> üí° Remember to document security challenges and mitigations </aside>

Incorporate a time-based one-time password (TOTP) system for an enhanced security layer following either the OAuth2 or conventional login. Utilize the pyotp library.
Upon registration, generate and display a QR code for users, allowing integration with 2FA apps like Google Authenticator.
During the login phase, request that the user input the TOTP from their authenticator app.
(20) Understanding the Concepts of OAuth2:
<aside> üí° Remember to document security challenges and mitigations. Also here, you can document the benefits of OAuth

</aside>

Develop an OAuth2 client using the Authorization Code Flow.
Fetch and securely store user details from the third-party provider in the database.
Sample Code
from flask import Flask, request, redirect, session
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = os.urandom(24)  # For session handling

# Mock constants for client ID and secret. 
CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
CLIENT_SECRET = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
REDIRECT_URI = "<http://localhost:5000/callback>"

AUTH_CODES = {}  # Temporary storage for auth codes. Use a proper database in a real-world scenario.
TOKENS = {}      # Temporary storage for access tokens.

@app.route("/auth", methods=["GET"])
def auth():
    """
    Endpoint where the client sends the user to request their authorization.
    After authorization, user is redirected back to the client with an auth code.
    """
    # TODO:
    # 1. Extract 'client_id', 'redirect_uri', 'state', etc. from the request.
    # 2. Validate 'client_id' and 'redirect_uri' against registered client details.
    # 3. Display an authorization page to the user to grant permission.
    # 4. If user grants permission, generate an authorization code.
    # 5. Save the authorization code and associated data.
    # 6. Redirect the user back to 'redirect_uri' with the 'code' and 'state'.
    pass

@app.route("/token", methods=["POST"])
def token():
    """
    Endpoint where the client exchanges the authorization code for an access token.
    """
    # TODO:
    # 1. Extract 'code', 'redirect_uri', 'client_id', 'client_secret' from the request.
    # 2. Verify that the 'code' is valid and has not expired.
    # 3. Validate 'client_id' and 'client_secret'.
    # 4. Generate an access token (and optionally, a refresh token).
    # 5. Save the access token for later validation.
    # 6. Return the access token (and optionally, a refresh token) in a JSON response.
    pass

@app.route("/protected_resource", methods=["GET"])
def protected_resource():
    """
    A protected endpoint the client can access using the access token.
    """
    # TODO:
    # 1. Extract the access token from the request's Authorization header.
    # 2. Validate the access token.
    # 3. If valid, proceed to access the protected resource and return the data.
    # 4. If invalid, return an appropriate error response.
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
Code to help on the way
The below Python script is sufficient to test that your OAUTH2 authentication flow works as expected. Note that you will have to use the exact route names and variables for this to work; otherwise, you need to adjust them. You are also recommended to take such tests yourself.

import requests

# Constants
CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
CLIENT_SECRET = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
REDIRECT_URI = "<http://localhost:5000/callback>"

# Step 1: Simulate getting the Authorization Code
auth_data = {
    'client_id': CLIENT_ID,
    'redirect_uri': REDIRECT_URI
}
response = requests.post("<http://localhost:5000/approve_auth>", data=auth_data)
# Extract auth_code from the response URL. This assumes the code is in the response URL's query parameters.
auth_code = response.url.split("code=")[1].split("&")[0]

# Step 2: Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token
token_data = {
    'code': auth_code,
    'redirect_uri': REDIRECT_URI,
    'client_id': CLIENT_ID,
    'client_secret': CLIENT_SECRET
}
response = requests.post("<http://localhost:5000/token>", data=token_data)
token_info = response.json()
access_token = token_info['access_token']

# Step 3: Access Protected Resource
headers = {'Authorization': f"Bearer {access_token}"}
response = requests.get("<http://localhost:5000/protected_resource>", headers=headers)
print(response.text)
